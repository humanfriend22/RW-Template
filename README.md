## üì¶ Project Description

Welcome to RW-Template! This project is an advanced **VEX V5 autonomous robotics template** focused on precise, algorithm-driven motion planning and control. It is designed for teams who want robust, adaptable autonomous routines with support for a wide range of sensor and drive configurations.

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Universal PID Class
- Modular, reusable PID controller for all motion and heading tasks.

### üìç Odometry
- Tracks robot position using drivetrain encoders and/or tracking wheels for accurate field navigation.

### üß≠ IMU Support
- Integrates inertial sensor (IMU) for heading correction and absolute orientation.

### üîÅ Tracking Wheel Flexibility
- Works with or without tracking wheels.
- Supports all tracking wheel configurations.
- Fall-back support using only drivetrain encoders and IMU for basic pose estimation.

### üéØ Turn to Face Point/Heading
- Algorithms to turn the robot to face any field point or specific heading.

### üîÑ Swing to Face Heading
- Swing turn routines for efficient, single-side turning to a point or heading.

### üèπ Move to Point
- Navigate to a specific coordinate using position and heading correction.
- Works consistently with or without tracking wheels.

### üìê Curve Path Movement (`curveCircle`)
- Executes smooth, circular/curved paths to a target point.
- Fully compatible with robots **not using tracking wheels or full odometry**.
- Uses heading + distance PID control to maintain curvature.

### üèπ Move to Pose via Boomerang
- Advanced ‚Äúboomerang‚Äù algorithm for smooth, curved motion to a target pose (position + heading).

### ‚õìÔ∏è Motion Chaining
- Seamlessly links multiple motion commands for fluid, uninterrupted autonomous routines.

## üìò Usage Guide

### 1. Project Structure

Your project is organized into the following folders and files:

**include/**
- `motor-control.h` ‚Äî Main drive and control function declarations  
- `robot-config.h` ‚Äî Device and sensor declarations  
- `utils.h` ‚Äî Math and utility functions

**src/**
- `main.cpp` ‚Äî Competition entry point and main logic  
- `motor-control.cpp` ‚Äî Main drive and control function implementations  
- `robot-config.cpp` ‚Äî Device and sensor setup  
- `utils.cpp` ‚Äî Math and utility function implementations  
- `autonomous.cpp` ‚Äî Your autonomous routines

### 2. Robot Configuration

Edit `robot-config.cpp` and `robot-config.h` to match your robot‚Äôs hardware.

- Set the correct ports for motors, sensors, and the controller  
- Group drive motors into `left_chassis` and `right_chassis` motor groups

### 3. Tuning Your Robot

In `motor-control.cpp`, locate the section labeled **USER-CONFIGURABLE PARAMETERS** and adjust the following:

- `distance_between_wheels`: Distance between the left and right wheels (in inches)  
- `wheel_distance_in`: Wheel circumference (see comments in code for help)  
- PID constants: `distance_kp`, `distance_ki`, `distance_kd`, etc.

If using tracking wheels:

- Set `using_tracking_wheels = true`  
- Configure tracker distances and diameters accordingly

### 4. Autonomous Programming

Edit `autonomous.cpp` to define your autonomous routines.

You can use the motion functions from `motor-control.h`:

- `driveTo(distance, time_limit, exit, max_output)`  
- `turnToAngle(angle, time_limit, exit, max_output)`  
- `moveToPoint(x, y, dir, time_limit, exit, max_output, overturn)`  
- `boomerang(x, y, dir, angle, dlead, time_limit, exit, max_output, overturn)`

Select the routine to run inside the `autonomous()` function in `main.cpp`.

### 5. Driver Control

Edit the `usercontrol()` function in `main.cpp`.

By default, it uses tank drive:

`driveChassis(ch3 * 0.12, ch2 * 0.12);`

You can customize this for:

- Arcade drive  
- Split arcade  
- Add button controls for mechanisms

### 6. Competition Setup

This template follows the VEX Competition structure:

- `pre_auton()` runs once at startup (ideal for sensor calibration)  
- `autonomous()` runs during the autonomous period  
- `usercontrol()` runs during the driver control period  
- The `main()` function connects all of these automatically

### 7. Tips for Success

- Read comments in each file ‚Äî they clarify how each function and variable works  
- Tune PID values for optimal performance  
- Test motion functions like `driveTo`, `turnToAngle`, and `moveToPoint` individually  
- Use odometry for advanced navigation (with or without tracking wheels)  
- Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to mentors or the VEX community for help

### 8. Where to Start

- Set up ports and devices in `robot-config.cpp` and `robot-config.h`  
- Input chassis measurements and PID values in `motor-control.cpp`  
- Confirm movement and controls via driver control testing  
- Create and test simple autonomous routines  
- Expand with more complex logic and paths as you grow confident

This template is **competition-ready** and provides a strong foundation for building reliable, high-performance autonomous routines using **proven robotics algorithms**, whether or not your robot uses advanced odometry.
